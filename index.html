      <p>
        "The Last Day of a Condemned Man" is a book by Victor Hugo. It's about a
        person who is going to be executed and the book shows what goes through
        their mind on the last day before the execution. The story makes us
        think about right and wrong, how society treats criminals, and whether
        the death penalty is fair. It's a sad and deep book that talks about big
        ideas through the thoughts of the main character."
